| Sprint Challenge = Responsive design |
---------------------------------------

1.) What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

        Responsive websites will change depending on the viewport of the browser. The code base doesn't need to be
        changed. Adaptive websites use anchor points to render a layout on specific screen sizes. 

2.)Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
        
	The mobile first approach is to design the site for a content focused layout and then progressive spreaded
	out over  as the screen size increases. Desktop first is the inverse of mobile first, it responds to the
        screen decreasing.

3.)What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

        It sets the rem at 62.5% of the default size, giving us an even amount to work with e.g. (2rem = 20px).

4.)How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
        
        Regular CSS is like the alphabet and a Preprocessor is like a book. The preprocessing power allows the 
        developer to condence things down into less code and make code easier to maintain.
